not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
incoherence reigns . 
it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
judd's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice . 
the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
cinematic poo . 
 " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
one of the worst films of 2002 . 
none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . . 
zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie . 
directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . 
hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
earnest but heavy-handed . 
the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
amazingly dopey . 
formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
a bit too eager to please . 
aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
this is so bad . 
nothing about it fits . 
a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . 
the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
 " roger michell ( " notting hill " ) directs a morality thriller . " 
wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . 
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
an ugly , revolting movie . 
everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , the full monty , with something different . 
it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
wait for it to hit cable . 
it's exactly what you'd expect . 
a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
 . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses  and ours  and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
bland but harmless . 
a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '
as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
 ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple  he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture
it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
doesn't amount to much of anything . 
a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash . 
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
one of those so-so films that could have been much better . 
it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
[stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . 
new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ? 
care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
 . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
the film is strictly routine . 
sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs . 
'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . 
no surprises . 
rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 
completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
 . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
it's splash without the jokes . 
as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
muddled , trashy and incompetent
here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
 in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
 . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
 . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
the story has little wit and no surprises . 
i'm just too bored to care . 
has the feel of an unedited personal journal . 
all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
[a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either . 
no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 
as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . 
a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
a puzzling experience . 
 . . . hypnotically dull . 
this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
 " analyze that " is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 
i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people . 
despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
the worst film of the year . 
soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit . 
egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
this is nothing but familiar territory . 
a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
a sour , nasty offering . 
though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career . 
an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
too clever by about nine-tenths . 
prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! is the kind of movie that's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression . 
a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
brisk hack job . 
at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
taken as a whole , the tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot . 
the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable . 
not once does it come close to being exciting . 
though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
great story , bad idea for a movie . 
there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
 . . . a rather bland affair . 
focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
too much power , not enough puff . 
there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
 " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment  until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados . 
it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .

makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep . 
the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible . 
writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
 . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets .

eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . 
this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .

davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .

no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
a major waste . . . generic . 
if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother .

they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place .

your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter . 
try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .

this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack . 
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . " 
if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 
other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
storytelling feels slight . 
director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .

pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . " 
 . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 
 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
a timid , soggy near miss . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply . 
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
[the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . 
not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .

there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .

in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
 . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
one thing's for sureif george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .

the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . " 
did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . 
the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .

despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs .

with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . 
circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
 it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .

just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv . 
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected .

the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . 
in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
a moving picture that does not move . 
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 
i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 
shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . . 
the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music . 
this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
it's just plain boring . 
the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
charming , if overly complicated . . . 
the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
 . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it . 
spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking . 
[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point  even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective . 
bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
in the end , there isn't much to it . 
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
a listless and desultory affair . 
the movie gets muted and routine . 
ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
 . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . 
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image . 
a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
a big fat pain . 
 . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
an extremely unpleasant film . 
without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers . 
isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser . 
the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
[e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
two hours of junk . 
fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany . 
friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 
the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
don't waste your money . 
one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
silly , loud and goofy . 
it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker . 
the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives . 
ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
little more than a frothy vanity project . 
collapses under its own meager weight . 
once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not . 
given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
`hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 
nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
arty gay film . 
a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
feeble comedy . 
the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
mildly amusing . 
what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen . 
a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
insufferably naive . 
 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
 . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmmmight i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
a lame comedy . 
the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . 
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
a dreadful live-action movie . 
jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
one long string of cliches . 
sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up . 
diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
 " bad " is the operative word for " bad company , " and i don't mean that in a good way . 
wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
been there done that . 
forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families . 
no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups . 
every note rings false . 
the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
 " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 
i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
drowning's too good for this sucker . 
there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con . 
the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
almost as offensive as " freddy got fingered . " 
this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess . 
often silly  and gross  but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy . 
this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work . 
the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
 . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
 . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do . 
i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist . 
rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
tends to plod . 
an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
ecks this one off your must-see list . 
let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
aggravating and tedious . 
anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
just not campy enough
ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
witless and utterly pointless . 
if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized . 
it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
they should have called it gutterball . 
historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
grating and tedious . 
alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
routine and rather silly . 
just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
too simple for its own good . 
the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também . 
these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 
 . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . 
more maudlin than sharp . 
one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat . 
fluffy and disposible . 
when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
well-made but mush-hearted . 
while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
thoroughly awful . 
it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
woody , what happened ? 
this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
a dreary movie . 
it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level . 
few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . 
suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes . 
it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 
 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
a sudsy cautionary tale . 
this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences . 
reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
showtime is closer to slowtime . 
not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
both awful and appealing . 
by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
the title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 
the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 
uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . 
does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock . 
plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . 
it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
too silly to take seriously . 
i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that . 
cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
 . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
this is a truly , truly bad movie . 
how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
[w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
flat , misguided comedy . 
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight , you're going to face frightening late fees . o . k . , not really . 
while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast . 
it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
an awful snooze . 
a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
crikey indeed . 
a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . 
a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
terrible . 
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
a little too pat for its own good . 
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
just plain silly . 
robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
a well-acted , but one-note film . 
a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
it bites hard . 
though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons  a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics . 
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel . 
is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
a sometimes tedious film . 
with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down . 
the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
 . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag . 
a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . . 
to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
woefully pretentious . 
it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
for dance completists only . 
this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . 
a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher . 
[l]ame and unnecessary . 
those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections . 
witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 
death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon . . . is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
at once half-baked and overheated . 
it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
just a bloody mess . 
never comes together as a coherent whole . 
a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . 
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped em together here . 
mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no . 
if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . 
the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
one lousy movie . 
a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
 . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished . 
the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms . sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine . 
despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
a relative letdown . 
i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 
if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes . 
the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable . 
although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes . 
 . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
by-the-numbers yarn . 
almost gags on its own gore . 
nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
[macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating . 
makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level . 
i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice . 
shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
humor in i spy is so anemic . 
this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
an incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been . 
it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future . 
unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
[allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring . 
 . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
 " i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time . 
lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
nothing about this movie works . 
the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
smothered by its own solemnity . 
an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
 . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
video games are more involving than this mess . 
a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
it drowns in sap . 
unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
boring and meandering . 
it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
it's just rather leaden and dull . 
a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 
nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
under-rehearsed and lifeless
must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
[t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
 . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
[director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . 
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
laughably , irredeemably awful . 
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
 . . . unbearably lame . 
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 
strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . 
the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
 " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
 " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
i hate this movie
it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
barely gets off the ground . 
it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
as vulgar as it is banal . 
tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
 . . . too sappy for its own good . 
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
[the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? 
stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
simplistic , silly and tedious . 
has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is . 
[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
 . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
banal and predictable . 
mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 
a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
press the delete key . 
the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés . 
yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
none of this is very original , and it isn't particularly funny . 
yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
it's just not very smart . 
i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 
christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
 . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
well-meaning but inert . 
 " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . 
the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
it tells more than it shows . 
there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
bearable . barely . 
any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon . 
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
[at least] moore is a real charmer .
