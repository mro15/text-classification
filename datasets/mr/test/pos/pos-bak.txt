armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama . 
the film oozes craft . 
fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half . 
all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline .

a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . . 
short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of eudora welty . 
blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological . 
the huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent .

a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera .

sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 
one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others .

never [sinks] into exploitation . 
the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself . 
more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet . 
it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . 
muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
sweet and memorable film . 
the date movie that franz kafka would have made . 
sex is one of those films that aims to confuse .

it just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read stevenson's book , which is a treasure in and of itself .

smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way .

ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid . 
an intoxicating experience .

the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life . 
at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise . 
it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .

poignant japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak . 
notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights .

if you thought tom hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you've seen him eight stories tall . 
my thoughts were focused on the characters . that is a compliment to kuras and miller . if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong . 
deliciously slow . 
often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .

it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate .

a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . 
a riveting story well told .

it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about .
